# Goal ü•Ö

To apply and enhance the skills gained throughout the Front-End Development - 1 program by creating a fully functional and responsive web application. This project will involve interpreting a brief, planning an effective solution, designing an intuitive user interface, and building the application using the following technologies and methodologies: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and project management best practices. The project will focus on delivering a polished and tested user experience that showcases our ability to design, develop, and optimize a modern, responsive website.

## Restrictions üö´

You may only use HTML, CSS and JavaScript ‚Äì no CSS or JavaScript Frameworks are permitted in this project (this includes Tailwind, Bootstrap, Vue, Svelte, React and similar packages).

## Brief üíº

You have been hired to build a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging application. The client has asked for a responsive web application that allows users to view dynamic blog posts. You will use your own account that you create to act as the owner to test the functionality. When you submit the project, your client needs to be able to register, login and manage their blog posts.

## Pages and User Stories üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Blog Feed Page - GET /blog/posts/<name>

/index.html

The Blog Feed Page needs to consist of a carousel and a list of at least 12 posts.

- As a user, I want to see an interactive banner carousel on the blog feed page, so that I can view a rotation of the 3 latest posts.
- As a user, I want to click on the previous or next button in the carousel to animate and reveal another post, to ensure I can see different posts easily.
- As a user, I want the carousel to return to the first post after reaching the end of the list, and vice versa when clicking previous on the first post.
- As a user, I want to click on a button for each carousel item, taking me to the blog post page to read more.
- As a user, I want to view a list of the 12 latest posts in a responsive thumbnail grid on the blog feed page, so I can easily select which post to read.
- As a user, I want each thumbnail image in the blog post feed to be clickable, taking me to the blog post page to read more about that specific blog post.

### Specific Blog Post Page - GET /blog/posts/<name>/<id>

/post/index.html

The Specific Blog Post Page features more details about a specific blog post that was navigated to from the thumbnail of the Blog Feed Page.

- As a user, I want to see a responsive layout showing the post‚Äôs title, author, publication date, image banner, and main content fetched from the API.
- As a user, I want each specific blog page to have a ‚Äúshare‚Äù icon that has shareable URL including a query string or hash parameter that contains the post ID, so I can share the post with others easily.

### Create Blog Post Page - POST /blog/posts/<name>

/post/create.html

The Create Blog Post Page features a form that accepts inputs from the owner in order to create a blog post.

### Blog Post Edit Page - PUT /blog/posts/<name>/<id>

- As the owner, I want a delete button on the edit form that sends a DELETE request to the API for this post ID on the edit page, so I can easily remove my post if needed.
- As the owner, I want a validated edit form that allows me to update the title, body content, or image by sending a POST request to the API for this post ID, ensuring I can keep my posts up to date easily.

### Account Login Page - POST /auth/login
